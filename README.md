# About
A Chunk List is a new, concurrent, chunk-based data structure that is easily modifiable and allows for fast runtime operations.

To find out more, check out the provided research paper:
  * /Chunk List/Presentation/"Chunk List.pdf" (DOI: 10.48550/arxiv.2101.00172)

# Usage
The __Presentation__ folder contains a full presentation and research paper in PDF and XPS formats, containing the following information:
  * What is a chunk list?
  * Where is a chunk list used?
  * Implementation details (construction, basic methods)
  * Complexity Analysis (Big-O)
  * Unit Testing
  * Integration

Program files are kept within the _master_ branch.

A full implementation of the class is kept within the __ChunkList.cs__ file in the namespace __Chunk_List__, to be included within the program.

The __Program.cs__ file contains a benchmark test for comparison between an ArrayList (List<T>) and Chunk List.
