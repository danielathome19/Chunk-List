# About
A Chunk List is a new, concurrent, chunk-based data structure that is easily modifiable and allows for fast run-time operations.

# Usage
The __Presentation__ folder contains a presentation in PDF, PowerPoint, and XPS formats, containing the following information:
  * What is a chunk list?
  * Where is a chunk list used?
  * Implementation details (construction, basic methods)
  * Complexity Analysis (Big-O)

Program files are kept within the _master_ branch.

A full implementation of the class is kept within the __ChunkList.cs__ file in a namespace __Chunk_List__, to be included within the program.

The __Program.cs__ file contains a benchmark test for comparison between an ArrayList (List<T>) and Chunk List.
